# Repository with Code and Data from R Workshop
## Summer 2024 - Yale Psychology

This repository has the code and data from an R Workshop run by Muji Chughtai (PhD Candidate in Psychology) for interns/RAs in the Yale Psychology Department. The code gives a brief introduction to using R for data cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis. Note that the data is not available, as it contains actual data from the RAs and interns.

HTML version of the code is available at https://rpubs.com/MujtabaChughtai/1207889
